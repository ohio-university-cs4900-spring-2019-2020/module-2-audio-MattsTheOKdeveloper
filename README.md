#### **IMAGINE**
You load into a world, but it's not much of a world, its a square plane of grass existence, an amazing plane and a beautiful sky that you could stare
at forever, but all is not as it seems. The first thing you notice is the jazz music in the air - you don't know where it's coming from - but you also hear 
something else. That's when you see it, a red orb in the sky. You move to investigate - as you get closer to the orb, another music source gets louder. 
Your head is overflowing with chaos, a mix of Jazz and Action Movie music. You don't know whats going on, the only thing you can think of is to hit escape 
to end it all. But wait, a solution appears before you. You find out the Up and Down arrows do something. You hit them both to see...

(hit up arrow and then down arrow before continuing)

...they do nothing but add to the chaos. Now the remainder of your existence is limited to the chaos of jazz and action music, and all
you have to do to pass the time is to play with a slide whistle.

You're Welcome.
